## Counting your days

It is said that, comming from a tourist visa exempted country, you are allowed to stay in Colombia for six months, but, how legally accurate is actually this affirmation?

Some more informed fellows say that you can stay for 90 days and can ask for an extension for 90 days more, in a calendar year.

Let's explain how the Entrance Permit and its extension work, so you will be able to make your future plans at ease.

The first thing to clarify is that the passport stamp you get at the airport is not a visa, although it works as such.

If you are comming from one of the following countries, you don't need

Q: Hi friends! Do I need to extend my tourist visa if a new year has begun? I arrived in October 2022 and technically my 3 months is up in January. However, I understand that I can stay in the country for 6 months this year, but does that mean I will need to extend twice? Muchas gracias!!

A: You apply for the extension online, you should start the application about 10 days before your 90th day. The Medellin office is always slow , so if you choose Manizales or Pereria from the drop down menu you will get your approval much faster. When your 90 day extension is up in April you will need to leave the country and return for the remainder of your 180 days in 2023.
