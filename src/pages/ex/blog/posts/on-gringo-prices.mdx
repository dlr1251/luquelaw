## On Gringo Prices

If you have ever seen a post on a facebook group of Expats regarding a real estate purchase, renting and/or any commercial operation regarding the transfer of money, you probably hear about gringo prices.

Regardless of the context, gringo prices are the place you really don't want to go, in case you want to preserve your finance’s health and self-esteem.

Gringo prices can be defined as the monetary values offered by (inescrupolous) locals to people who: a) does not speak spanish as their mother tongue; b) has a funny accent; c) has obvious non-andean-caribbean phenotypical features such as blue eyes, blond hair, tall, white skin. Etc; d) wears sandals and short pants.

which normally are way above the 'normal' prices.

The phenomena is easily viewed pretty much everywhere in the world. From Miami to Cape Town, from Berlin to Seoul. Some reffer to it as the "tourist trap".

Have you ever purchased a $3USD bottle of water at an airport? a $10USD meal that normally would cost only $2?

Depending on the spot, the prices might get way higher or lower, because of the well know law of offer and demand.

But, as unfair as this seems, it's how capitalism works and is the least worst known economic system . It has been proven over and over again that when the government  sets fixed prices, industries tend to disappear or black, illegal markets tend to appear. But that is for another blog post.

Yet having to pay 300% more for a beer at a certain restaurant than in the supermarket, is something more comprehensible than having to pay more just because of your nationality, the color of your skin or any other body features. It's something that ressembles a bit too much to plain racism.

Do not misinterpret me. There are very good reasons for locals to do so: The level of poverty and scarcity is nowhere to be seen in the first world countries; the lack of education, opportunities, jobs and infrastructure pushes a big chunk of the population to dispair and drama families that in a lot of cases end up in crime organizations, immoral businesses and so on.

But, in my opinion, elevating the prices highly without a correspondent added value (speculation) might do more harm than good in the long run for the local economy, so there are a couple of "good-to-know" infos within the colombian legal system regarding business operations with properties. Notice that these laws also protect you being a foreigner. It is not that you for beeing a foreigner do not have rights, or that locals have more rights than you. That is definitely not the case.

According to the constitution, whenever you have legally entered and stayed on the country,

Never had I thought I would be in the position to explain the immoral consequences of free market (and its benefits) to US citizens.

(I don't want to make this essay too long. But I  do want to make it as precise as it gets)

So, if you are willing to purchase an appartment - finca - house or a warehouse in Colombia (which is a good idea). Please consider these comments:

The price and the value.

When talking about real estate in Colombia, you will most likely hear two numbers regarding the price of the property:

There are two values that you will hear often. The first value is the cadastral value. The second is the commercial value.

As in many cities-states or legal systems, Colombia has adopted the cadastral system. Which is like an inventory system of all the land. Naturally, as you may already know, Colombia has had historical problems and conflicts with the land since the independence days. But with the current system, all the land is inventorized there.

Every municipio has an office of catastto. There they keep a price that is calculated as follows:

### Investigar como se calcula el valor catastral de los inmuebles.

Needless to say, that price is way lower than the commercial value. Why is that so?

Enter: Impuesto predial.

The impuesto predial is an anual tax that every private landlord (except churches and ngos, but that is for another post)

There's currently an ongoing effort to make the multi-purpose cadastral system available for all the population, which will give

Colombian legal system, as most liberal - Napoleonic-influenced systems is based on the free will of the contractors. That is, both parties have a big freedom to determine whatever they want, with a few prohibitions (but that's the subject for another post)

There are two rules that limit the prices on rent and on purchase/trade of property:

Lesion enorme:

Is a civil sanction that applies when a seller sells for less than half of the "fair price" of the estate. Or when the purchaser purchases for more than twice the "fair price" of the estate

On rent:

This rule is to be found on the article xx of the lay 820 de 2001.

This paragraph states that the maximum price for an urban rent for living is 1% of the commercial value

The rent contract can be orally or written.

Theoretically, It is not necessary to be written, yet is much helpful to have it written for the following reasons.

Say, one day you wake up and your landlord tells you you have 24h to leave the place. You say

The limit is 1% of the commercial value of the land.
