# The Digital Nomad Visa Confusion
There is confusion and ongoing discussions in FB groups and internet forums regarding the Colombian Digital Nomad Visa, specifically whether or not you can stay in Colombia for two consecutive years without having to leave.

- Why do people insist that you can only stay for 180 days in a year?
- Why do they argue that, even though the validity of that kind of visa is 2 years, you are only allowed to stay in the country for 180 days during that period?
- Why even experienced visa agencies and Colombian consulates abroad seem to believe that same thing?

As a local lawyer getting questions like this every day and seeing that the public administration and Migración Colombia is failing to provide an official clarification, I would like to address this very important topic to help Digital Nomads and expats manage things appropriately so they can continue with their plans to keep on living and enjoying their worldwide travels.

Let's start by checking the apple crux of the matter, which can be found in the paragraph of [article 46 in the Resolución 5477 de 2022](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_minrelaciones_5477_2022.htm#46) of Migración Colombia.

This is the text of the paragraph (in Spanish):

> PARÁGRAFO: Los nómadas digitales, trabajadores remotos y emprendedores digitales de nacionalidades que no requieren visa para corta estancia, establecidas mediante Resolución, podrán ingresar sin visa y permanecer en Colombia con **Permiso de Ingreso** otorgado por la autoridad migratoria, de acuerdo con la norma vigente; siempre que su permanencia en el país no genere pagos de empresas colombianas y su periodo de permanencia no sea superior a 90 días que podrá extenderse hasta máximo 180 días continuos o discontinuos año calendario.

I have emphasised the term that is causing all this confusion. But I'll return to this later.

A simple translation using DeepL or Google Translate will throw this result:

>PARAGRAPH: Digital nomads, remote workers and digital entrepreneurs of nationalities that  do not require a visa for a short stay, established by Resolution, may enter without a visa and stay in Colombia with an Entry Permit granted by the immigration authority, in accordance with current regulations, provided that their stay in the country does not generate payments from Colombian companies and their period of stay does not exceed 90 days, which may be extended up to a maximum of 180 continuous or discontinuous days per calendar year.

This automated translation is grammatically accurate (thank you, DeepL), but its difficulty of interpretation comes not only from its unnecessarily technical formulation, but also from the specific legal meaning of  concepts  embedded in the paragraph.

Pay attention to the detail, for, as they say the devil is in the details.

### 1. Who are they referring to?

Let's start by checking the subject of this paragraph, that is, the people to whom this rule applies. In other words, who should care about this paragraph?

The answer can be found in the first part of the paragraph, that goes like this:

> Digital nomads, remote workers and digital entrepreneurs of nationalities that do not require a visa for short stay, established by Resolution

In this part, you can see that the law is talking about _digital nomads, remote workers and digital entrepreneurs_.

What should be understood by _digital nomads_? This visa type was first conceived by another law, that is [Ley 2069 de 2020](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/ley_2069_2020.htm#16), in this law, on its article 16, the legislator provides a clear definition of digital nomads:


<div class="alert shadow-lg">
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="stroke-info flex-shrink-0 w-6 h-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13 16h-1v-4h-1m1-4h.01M21 12a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z"></path></svg>
    (…) include people dedicated to remote and/or independent work, including the modalities of teleworking, remote work and/or work from home (…)
</div>

The second part of the sentence states that these digital nomads have nationalities from countries that don't require a visa for a short stay. The list of the countries is found on the [Resolución 5488 de 2022](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_minrelaciones_5488_2022.htm).

You don't need to read the resolution, since I've written down the countries in this table so you can use the Notion search function.

Note that there are 100 countries that are exempt from needing a visa, so if you are coming from Zambia or Turkmenistan, or good old North Korea, you have to find another visa type to bring your activities here.

<div class="alert alert-info">For the nationals of Cambodia, China, India, Nicaragua, Thailand and Vietnam, it is provided that a person may enter without a visa and with an Entrance Permit if he/she is a visa holder or resident in the USA or any country who is a signatory of the Schengen agreement with a minimum validity of 180 days at the time of the entrance.</div>

### 2. What does the rule provide for the digital nomads from the exempted countries?
The norm provides that the foreigners from said nationalities may enter and stay in Colombia with an _Entrance Permit_

> (…) podrán ingresar sin visa y permanecer en Colombia con Permiso de Ingreso otorgado por laautoridad migratoria, de acuerdo con la norma vigente

Again, the details make huge differences. Note the capital case in the expression “Permiso de Ingreso”. This is not by chance nor mistake. This is because they are referring to a noun that has a special regulation.

The Entrance Permit is a legal institution. It is an administrative allowance granted by the Government to enter and stay in the country and as such is NOT a visa. It is a proof of exemption.

The definition of said concept can be found in another rule, specifically in the [Resolución 3167 de 2019](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_uaemc_3167_2019.htm#2), that goes like this:

<div class="alert alert-info"> Entry and Permanence Permit (PIP): Permission granted by the Colombian Migration Special Administrative Unit at the time of entering the country to foreigners who do not require a visa, for short-term periods, carrying out non-profit work.</div>

Please note the last line "carrying out non-profit work": As a general rule, foreigners who enter the country with an Entrance Permit are not allowed to work for Colombian companies nor to start businesses.

But why? Aren't the foreigners investing money into the local economy? Why would they put barriers to foreign investment?

Although you are _right_ and I agree with you, in theory, this control is necessary to protect the economy from foreign interference and to avoid illegal immigrant workers.

There is also another rule that provides that if a company hires a foreign employee without a work permit, then that company could be subject to a sanction of up to $400 Million pesos. This is not trivial.

### 3. Clarifications that don't clarify but confuse.
Finally, the paragraph ends with a “clarification” that has caused a lot of confusion, and is as follows:

(…) provided that their stay in the country does not generate payments from Colombian companies and their period of stay does not exceed 90 days, which may be extended up to a maximum of 180 continuous or discontinuous days per calendar year.

This is the default rule of an Entrance Permit: You are allowed to stay, with an Entrance Permit, for 90 days which may be extended up to a maximum of 180 continuous or discontinuous dates per calendar year.

Now, considering the strong prohibition against allowing illegal workers in Colombia, the goal of this paragraph is to say that you can “work” as a digital nomad or entrepreneur in Colombia as long as it is for foreign clients or companies.

In my opinion, this paragraph should be formulated differently, but hey, were the laws nice and clear, we lawyers would have to find a different job.

### 4. Conclusion

Considering all the above, then yes, you can stay in Colombia for 1 or 2 years, uninterruptedly, as long as your visa is valid. This means that if they give you 1 year, you can stay 365 days, and if they give you 2 years, you can stay 730 days.
