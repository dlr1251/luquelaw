title: The Digital Nomad Visa Confusion
author: Himanshu
description: More information!
---
There is confusion and ongoing discussions in FB groups and internet forums regarding the Colombian Digital Nomad Visa, specifically whether or not you can stay in Colombia for two
consecutive years without having to leave.

Why do people insist that you can only stay for 180 days in a year?

Why do they argue that, even though the validity of that kind of visa is 2 years, you are only allowed to stay in the country for 180 days during that period?

Why even experienced visa agencies and Colombian consulates abroad seem to believe that same thing?

As a local lawyer getting questions like this every day and seeing that the public administration and Migración Colombia is failing to provide an official clarification, I would like to address this very important topic to help Digital Nomads and expats manage things appropriately so they can continue with their plans to keep on living and enjoying their worldwide travels.

Let’s start by checking the apple crux of the matter, which can be found in the paragraph of article 46 in the Resolución 5477 de 2022 of Migración Colombia.

This is the text of the paragraph (in Spanish):

PARÁGRAFO: Los nómadas digitales, trabajadores remotos y emprendedores digitales de nacionalidades que no requieren visa para corta estancia, establecidas mediante Resolución, podrán ingresar sin visa y permanecer en Colombia con Permiso de Ingreso otorgado por la autoridad migratoria, de acuerdo con la norma vigente; siempre que su permanencia en el país no genere pagos de empresas colombianas y su periodo de permanencia no sea superior a 90 días que podrá extenderse hasta máximo 180 días continuos o discontinuos año calendario.

I’ve highlighted and expression that is causing all this confusion. But I’ll return to this later.

A simple translation using DeepL or Google Translate will throw this result:

PARAGRAPH: Digital nomads, remote workers and digital entrepreneurs of nationalities that
do not require a visa for a short stay, established by Resolution, may enter without a visa and stay
in Colombia with an Entry Permit granted by the immigration authority, in accordance with
current regulations, provided that their stay in the country does not generate payments from
Colombian companies and their period of stay does not exceed 90 days, which may be extended
up to a maximum of 180 continuous or discontinuous days per calendar year.
This automated translation is grammatically accurate (thank you, DeepL), but its difficulty of
interpretation comes not only because it is counterintuitive, but also from some legal concepts
that are embedded in the paragraph that have a particular meaning in the context of a legal text,
and are difficult to understand for someone unfamiliar with the legalities involved.
Pay attention to the details, for, as they say the devil is in the details.
1. Who are they referring to?
Let’s start by checking the subject of this paragraph, that is, the people to whom this law applies.
In other words, who should is effected by the contents of this paragraph?
The answer can be found in the first part of the paragraph, that goes like this:
Digital nomads, remote workers and digital entrepreneurs of nationalities that do not require a
visa for short stay, established by Resolution
Los nómadas digitales, trabajadores remotos y emprendedores digitales de nacionalidades que no
requieren visa para corta estancia, establecidas mediante Resolución.
In this part, you can see that the law is talking about digital nomads, remote workers and digital
entrepreneurs.
Who are digital nomads in relation to this law? This visa type was first conceived by another law,
that is Ley 2069 de 2020, in this law, on its article 16, the legislature provides a clear definition
of digital nomads:
(…) include people dedicated to remote and/or independent work, including the modalities of
teleworking, remote work and/or work from home (…)
(…) incluyen a personas dedicadas a realizar trabajo remoto y/o independiente, incluyendo las
modalidades de teletrabajo, trabajo a distancia y/o trabajo remoto (…)
The second part of the sentence states that these digital nomads are citizens from countries that
don’t require a visa for a short stay. The list of the countries is found on the Resolución 5488 de
2022.
You don’t need to read the resolution, since I’ve provided the countries involved in the table
below so you can use the Notion search function.
Note that there are 100 countries that are exempt from needing a visa, so if you are coming from
Zambia or Turkmenistan, or good old North Korea, you have to find another visa type to bring
your activities here.

For the nationals of Camboya, China, India, Nicaragua, Thailand and Vietnam, it is a
person may enter without a visa and with an Entrance Permit if he/she is a visa holder or resident
in the USA or any country who is a signatory of the Schengen agreement with a minimum
validity of 180 days at the time of the entrance.

### 2. What does the rule permit for the digital nomads from the exempted countries?
The rule provides that the foreigners from said nationalities may enter and stay in Colombia with
an Entrance Permit (written below in Spanish):
(…) podrán ingresar sin visa y permanecer en Colombia con Permiso de Ingreso otorgado por la
autoridad migratoria, de acuerdo con la norma vigente
Again, the details make a huge difference. Note that the the expression “Permiso de Ingreso” is
highlighted in italics. This is because they are referring to something that has a special
regulation.
The Entrance Permit is a legal concept. It is an administrative allowance granted by the
Government to enter and stay in the country and as such is NOT a visa. It is a proof of exemption.
The definition of this concept can be found in another rule, specifically in the RESOLUCIÓN
3167 DE 2019, that is written below: (in Spanish)
Permiso de Ingreso y Permanencia (PIP): Permiso otorgado por la Unidad Administrativa
Especial Migración Colombia al momento de ingresar al país, a los extranjeros que no requieran
visa, en períodos de corta estancia, adelantando labores sin ánimo de lucro.
Entry and Permanence Permit (PIP): Permission granted by the Colombian Migration Special Administrative Unit at the time of entering the country to foreigners who do not require a visa, for short-term periods, carrying out non-profit work.

Please note the underlined bolded text: As a general rule, foreigners who enter the country with an Entrance Permit are not allowed to work for Colombian companies or start businesses.

But why? Aren’t the foreigners investing money into the local economy? Why would they put barriers to foreign investment?

Although you are right and I agree with you in theory, this control is necessary to protect the economy from foreign interference and to avoid illegal immigrant workers.

There is also another rule that provides that if a company hires a foreign employee without a work permit, then that company could be subject to a sanction of up to $400 Million pesos, which is not a trivial amount.

### 3. Clarifications that don’t clarify but confuse.
Finally, the paragraph ends with a “clarification” that has caused a lot of confusion:

(…) provided that their stay in the country does not generate payments from Colombian companies and their period of stay does not exceed 90 days, which may be extended up to a maximum of 180 continuous or discontinuous days per calendar year.

This is the default rule of an Entrance Permit: You are allowed to stay, with an Entrance Permit, for 90 days which may be extended up to a maximum of 180 continuous or discontinuous dates per calendar year.

Now, considering the strong prohibition against allowing illegal workers in Colombia, the goal of this paragraph is to say that you can “work” as a digital nomad or entrepreneur in Colombia as long as it is for foreign clients or companies.

In my opinion, this paragraph should be written differently, but hey, were the laws nice and clear, we lawyers would have to find a different job �

### Conclusion

Considering all the above, you can stay in Colombia for 1 or 2 years, uninterrupted, as long as your visa is valid. This means that if they give you 1 year, you can stay 365 days, and if they give you 2 years, you can stay 730 days.
